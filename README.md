# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA),where I explore and analyze datasets to derive insights and patterns. Below is an overview of the projects in this repository:

## 1. Global Terrorism EDA

- File: `Global_Terrorism_EDA.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook presents an exploratory analysis of global terrorism data. Using descriptive statistics and visualizations, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in terrorist incidents worldwide

### Dataset:
- File: `Global Terrorism Dataset.md`
- Description: This document provides detailed information about the Global Terrorism dataset used in the corresponding EDA notebook.
