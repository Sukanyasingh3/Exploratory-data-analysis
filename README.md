# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA),where I explore and analyze datasets to derive insights and patterns. Below is an overview of the projects in this repository:

## 1. Global Terrorism EDA

- File: `Global_Terrorism_EDA.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook presents an exploratory analysis of global terrorism data. Using descriptive statistics and visualizations, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in terrorist incidents worldwide.

## 2. Students Data EDA

- File: `Students_Data_EDA.ipynb`
- Description: This project involves the exploratory analysis of a dataset related to student information. The notebook explores various aspects of student data, such as demographics, academic performance, and other relevant factors.

## 3. eCommerce Behavior Analysis

- File: `eCommerce_behavior_EDA.ipynb`
- Dataset: `eCommerce_behavior_EDA.ipynb`
- Description: In this analysis, I delve into the eCommerce Behavior dataset to uncover insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends in online shopping. The notebook includes visualizations and statistical summaries to enhance understanding.

## 4. eCommerce Behavior Dataset

- File: `eCommerce Behavior Dataset.md`
- Description: This document provides detailed information about the eCommerce Behavior dataset used in the corresponding EDA notebook. It includes data sources, features, and any additional context necessary for understanding the dataset.

## 5. Student Extended ML Dataset

- File: `student_extended_ml_dataset2.csv`
- Description: This dataset is an extension of the student data exploration, providing additional features for potential machine learning applications. The file includes an updated dataset with new variables for further analysis and modeling.

Feel free to explore each project's respective notebook or document for a more in-depth understanding of the datasets and insights derived through exploratory data analysis.
